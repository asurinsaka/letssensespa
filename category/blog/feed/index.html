<p>Massage can be a powerful tool to help you take charge of your health and well-being. See if it&#8217;s right for you.</p>



<p>Massage is no longer available only through luxury spas and upscale 
health clubs. Today, massage therapy is offered in businesses, clinics, 
hospitals and even airports. If you&#8217;ve never tried massage, learn about 
its possible health benefits and what to expect during a massage therapy
 session.</p>



<h3>What is massage?</h3>



<p>Massage is a general term for pressing, rubbing and manipulating your
 skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments. Massage may range from light 
stroking to deep pressure. There are many different types of massage, 
including these common types:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Swedish massage.</strong> This is a gentle form of massage 
that uses long strokes, kneading, deep circular movements, vibration and
 tapping to help relax and energize you.</li><li><strong>Deep massage.</strong> This massage technique uses slower, 
more-forceful strokes to target the deeper layers of muscle and 
connective tissue, commonly to help with muscle damage from injuries.</li><li><strong>Sports massage.</strong> This is similar to Swedish massage,
 but it&#8217;s geared toward people involved in sport activities to help 
prevent or treat injuries.</li><li><strong>Trigger point massage.</strong> This massage focuses on areas of tight muscle fibers that can form in your muscles after injuries or overuse.</li></ul>



<h3>Benefits of massage</h3>



<p>Massage is generally considered part of complementary and integrative
 medicine. It&#8217;s increasingly being offered along with standard treatment
 for a wide range of medical conditions and situations.</p>



<p>Studies of the benefits of massage demonstrate that it is an effective treatment for reducing stress, pain and muscle tension.</p>



<p>While more research is needed to confirm the benefits of massage, some studies have found massage may also be helpful for:</p>



<ul><li>Anxiety</li><li>Digestive disorders</li><li>Fibromyalgia</li><li>Headaches</li><li>Insomnia related to stress</li><li>Myofascial pain syndrome</li><li>Soft tissue strains or injuries</li><li>Sports injuries</li><li>Temporomandibular joint pain</li></ul>



<p>Beyond the benefits for specific conditions or diseases, some people 
enjoy massage because it often produces feelings of caring, comfort and 
connection.</p>



<p>Despite its benefits, massage isn&#8217;t meant as a replacement for 
regular medical care. Let your doctor know you&#8217;re trying massage and be 
sure to follow any standard treatment plans you have.</p>



<h3>Risks of massage</h3>



<p>Most people can benefit from massage. However, massage may not be appropriate if you have:</p>



<ul><li>Bleeding disorders or take blood-thinning medication</li><li>Burns or healing wounds</li><li>Deep vein thrombosis</li><li>Fractures</li><li>Severe osteoporosis</li><li>Severe thrombocytopenia</li></ul>



<p>Discuss the pros and cons of massage with your doctor, especially if you are pregnant or you have cancer or unexplained pain.</p>



<p>Some forms of massage can leave you feeling a bit sore the next day. 
But massage shouldn&#8217;t ordinarily be painful or uncomfortable. If any 
part of your massage doesn&#8217;t feel right or is painful, speak up right 
away. Most serious problems come from too much pressure during massage.</p>



<h3>What you can expect during a massage</h3>



<p>You don&#8217;t need any special preparation for massage. Before a massage 
therapy session starts, your massage therapist should ask you about any 
symptoms, your medical history and what you&#8217;re hoping to get out of 
massage. Your massage therapist should explain the kind of massage and 
techniques he or she will use.</p>



<p>In a typical massage therapy session, you undress or wear 
loose-fitting clothing. Undress only to the point that you&#8217;re 
comfortable. You generally lie on a table and cover yourself with a 
sheet. You can also have a massage while sitting in a chair, fully 
clothed. Your massage therapist should perform an evaluation through 
touch to locate painful or tense areas and to determine how much 
pressure to apply.</p>



<p>Depending on preference, your massage therapist may use oil or lotion
 to reduce friction on your skin. Tell your massage therapist if you 
might be allergic to any ingredients.</p>



<p>A massage session may last from 10 to 90 minutes, depending on the 
type of massage and how much time you have. No matter what kind of 
massage you choose, you should feel calm and relaxed during and after 
your massage.</p>



<p>If a massage therapist is pushing too hard, ask for lighter pressure.
 Occasionally you may have a sensitive spot in a muscle that feels like a
 knot. It&#8217;s likely to be uncomfortable while your massage therapist 
works it out. But if it becomes painful, speak up.</p>



<h3>Finding a massage therapist</h3>



<p>Ask your doctor or someone else you trust for a recommendation. Most 
states regulate massage therapists through licensing, registration or 
certification requirements.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask a potential massage therapist such questions as:</p>



<ul><li>Are you licensed, certified or registered?</li><li>What is your training and experience?</li><li>How many massage therapy sessions do you think I&#8217;ll need?</li><li>What&#8217;s the cost, and is it covered by health insurance?</li></ul>



<h3>The take-home message about massage</h3>



<p>
Brush aside any thoughts that massage is only a feel-good way to indulge
 or pamper yourself. To the contrary, massage can be a powerful tool to 
help you take charge of your health and well-being, whether you have a 
specific health condition or are just looking for another stress 
reliever. You can even learn how to do self-massage or how to engage in 
massage with a partner at home.

<p>People  are usually stressed out in living a mechanical life daily. They tend  to stay more at their work places than at their homes. Let&#8217;s Sense Spa  is aimed towards giving people complete relaxation and pleasure of both  the mind and body. The massage is done using herbal oils which are  administered to go deep into a person’s cellular pores to release muscle  pulls and tissue tensions.

The massage not only eliminates stress and anxiety but also satisfies a client’s libido.

Fortunately, many of the problems associated with bad back or literal pain in the neck have been treated by the medical industry with great strides. Back and neck pain are some of the most common reasons for millions of Americans for disability, missed work and absolutely miserable days and nights. Fortunately, many of the problems associated with bad back or literal pain in the neck have been treated by the medical industry with great strides. Consider the following list of the ten most common causes of back pain and neck pain to gain a better understanding of how these things can happen to anyone at any time and wherever possible avoid them. 10 Most common reasons for back and neck pain </span></p>
<h2>10 of the main causes of back and neck pain</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Old Age. </strong>All right, everything depends on your old perspective. If you&#8217;re young enough, you might think 35 are old, and we&#8217;re not talking about that here. The fact is, however, that many people over the age of 50 have lower back pain. It is mainly caused by a gradual degeneration of the joints in the spine caused by osteoarthritis and spinal stenosis.</li>
<li><strong>Sports. </strong>We hate age, but playing high-impact sports such as basketball, soccer and other similarly rigorous athletic activities is much better suited for children and young adults than people in their 40s, 50s and beyond. While these activities are still a healthy idea for anyone of any age, they pose a risk of pain in the neck and back. Proceed with due awareness and caution. If you continue to have problems performing such athletics, consider more low-impact activities such as swimming or cycling.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep. </strong>Sleeping in awkward positions can cause nasty pain in the neck the next morning. It can be bad for your back to sleep on your stomach. The best option is usually to use a therapeutic pillow while avoiding any uncomfortable force on the neck or back during the night.</li>
<li><strong>Poor Posture. </strong>Cyber employees today are not ideal for a healthy neck and back. While sitting at a computer terminal or driving to the office, the posture that involves craning your neck forward is a big culprit for neck and back pain. Get up and move about every 20-30 minutes to exercise and stretch your spine if possible.</li>
<li><strong>Fender Benders. </strong>The morning travel is filled with people who drive with one eye open from a lack of sleep and one hand on a cup of coffee to try to rectify the situation. This is a big fender bender waiting to happen in the stop-and-go traffic of today&#8217;s overcrowded morning commutes. These little &#8220;taps&#8221; on the back of your car can cause a whiplash that causes the head and neck to plunge at high speed.</li>
<li><strong>Herniated Disc. </strong>This condition can cause no noticeable symptoms if you&#8217;re lucky. If you&#8217;re not as lucky, you may need a moderate medical procedure. Pain from a herniated disc occurs when one of the disks in your spine between the vertebrae is damaged and irritates the nerve nearby. If you suspect that your pain is from a herniated disk, seek help from a doctor who can perform a minimally invasive procedure to easily rectify this situation. These exercises can also be tried to help deal with degenerative disk disease.</li>
<li><strong>Forget Me Not. </strong>Even something as routine and harmless as taking the trash out or playing in the backyard with the kids can cause neck and back pain if you&#8217;re not careful. Perform physical activity at all times with care. If possible, never twist, bend or reach from an awkward position.</li>
<li><strong>Fracture. </strong>There is a possibility of fracture from osteoporosis in older adults, especially postmenopausal women. Anything that exerts a little extra force on the spine can cause a fracture of the hairline &#8211; perhaps something as routine as a sneeze.</li>
<li><strong>Overweight. </strong>Nothing puts too much pressure on your spine. Consult your doctor for a healthy program consisting of a sensible diet with mild to moderate exercise in order to avoid problems with the neck or back caused by excessive weight gain.</li>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many studies indicate various spa therapies benefit the human body on a physiological level, far beyond the relaxation engendered by visiting a spa. By developing a deeper understanding of the health benefits and applications of spa therapies, a massage therapist can choose to offer spa-type services to clients in order to improve both outcomes and income.</p>
<p>A massage therapist does not need to work in a spa to provide clients a spa-like experience; however, in order to offer the spa add-ons described in this article, a massage therapist must obtain in-depth continuing education in spa techniques.</p>
<p>Spas do have the advantage of space, professional resources, equipment and personal instruction to provide guests services to help regain balance, change lifestyle habits and enhance their lives; however, with education and adapted protocols, massage therapists can enhance sessions with such spa techniques as hydrotherapy; cold-mitt friction; salt, sugar or herbal scrubs; infrared light and sauna; and cold-sheet, mud, clay, seaweed and herbal wraps.</p>
