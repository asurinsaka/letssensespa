<p>Thai massage is new to modern spas, but it is actually an ancient form of massage thought to have been developed by Buddhist monks in Thailand 2,500 years ago. It uses passive stretching and gentle pressure along the body&#8217;s energy lines to increase flexibility, relieve muscle and joint tension, and balance the body&#8217;s energy system.</p>



<h2>What happens during a Thai massage</h2>



<p>Thai massage typically works with compression &#8212; rhythmic pressing movements directed into muscle tissues by either the hand or fingers. Thai massage can be both relaxing and energizing, so it is a good choice if you want to be active after your massage.</p>



<h2>The benefits of Thai massage</h2>



<ol><li>Lowers stress &#8211; Too much stress can negatively affect mental and physical health. Chronic, or long-lasting stress can lead to serious illnesses, including depression and cardiovascular disease. Thai massage uses gentle pressure and stretching techniques to relax the body.</li><li>Boost energy &#8211; Research has shown that Thai massage can increase people&#8217;s physical energy levels. The Thai massage technique is based on the notion of energy lines, or Sen. Most practitioners believe that there are various Sen, or channels, of energy within the body.</li><li>Relieves headaches &#8211; One 2015 study found count-type Thai massage is an effective treatment for people who have chronic tension headaches.</li><li>Stimulates circulation &#8211; Thai massage can promote the circulation of both blood and lymph through the use of gentle stretches. These yoga-like stretches increase blood circulation, which fills the body&#8217;s tissues with oxygen. This helps promote cell growth and hearth health.</li><li>Improve range of motion &#8211; Thai massage incorporates yoga-like stretches to reducer stress and improve circulation. The gradual, gental stretching will enhance the person&#8217;s flexibility over time, allowing a greater range of motion. </li></ol>
